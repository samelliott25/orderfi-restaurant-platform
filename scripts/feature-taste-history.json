        "reasoning": "User Experience: 7/10 - AI-powered upselling can enhance the user experience by providing personalized recommendations, but it must be implemented carefully to avoid being intrusive or overwhelming. The feature should be seamlessly integrated into the ordering flow to ensure it remains intuitive and fast.\n\nBusiness Value: 8/10 - Upselling has the potential to increase average order value and drive revenue growth. Given the positive trends in \"Add to Cart\" and \"Checkout Started,\" introducing upselling could capitalize on these behaviors, provided it doesn't add friction to the process.\n\nTechnical Excellence: 6/10 - AI solutions can be complex to maintain and require significant data to perform well. Ensuring the AI is performant and secure is crucial, but without defined API test results, the technical reliability remains uncertain.\n\nCompetitive Advantage: 5/10 - While AI-powered upselling is increasingly common in the industry, a well-executed version could still offer a competitive edge. However, without data on competitor features, it's unclear how unique or market-leading this would be.\n\nImplementation Feasibility: 6/10 - Implementing AI requires data infrastructure and expertise, which may not be low-effort. If the team has existing AI capabilities, this could be more feasible, but the undefined API test results suggest potential challenges.\n\nOverall recommendation: Consider\n\nKey insight: AI-powered upselling could enhance revenue and user experience, but its success hinges on careful implementation and robust technical support.",
