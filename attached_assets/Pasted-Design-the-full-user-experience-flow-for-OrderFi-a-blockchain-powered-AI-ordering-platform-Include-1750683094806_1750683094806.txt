Design the full user experience flow for OrderFi, a blockchain-powered AI ordering platform. Include both customer and restaurant owner perspectives.

The platform should feel intuitive, fast, and intelligent — powered by a conversational AI assistant that takes orders, manages upsells, and builds rapport. It must also be mobile-first and Web3-native, integrating crypto payments and tokenized loyalty.

👨‍🍳 Restaurant Owner Journey
1. Onboarding
Sign up with email or connect Web3 wallet

OrderFi AI parses and categorizes items using NLP + Vision

2. Menu Optimization

4. Monitor Orders & Feedback

Customer feedback is automatically parsed and sentiment-tagged

5. Loyalty & Payments
See token-based reward metrics (e.g., $ORDER token earned per order)

Optional integration with POS or accounting software
