Yes—behind the same URL you’ll support two entry-points:

Guest Mode (BYO-QR → wallet connect → chat UI for ordering and payment)

Venue Mode (staff/managers → secure login → management console)

For the MVP Venue Console, lean hard on what Square, Lightspeed, Me&U and others all include at launch. Focus on the absolute essentials your restaurant needs to:

Page / Feature	Core Purpose	Why It’s MVP-Critical
Dashboard	At-a-glance stats: Today’s sales, open orders, low-stock alerts, key metrics.	One-glance health check so staff know what needs attention first.
Menu & Item Management	Create/edit items, prices, categories, modifiers, images.	Every sale runs off your menu—must be able to update on the fly.
Inventory	Live stock levels, reorder thresholds, supplier POs.	Prevent stock-outs and automate reorders before you run dry.
Orders	Live order queue (Dine-in, takeaway, delivery), order details, status updates.	You need to see, manage and fire orders to the kitchen or bar instantly.
Payments & Reconciliation	View all payments (on-chain txns), refunds, daily batch reconcile.	Even on-chain you still need to tie payments back to orders and close out.
Staff & Access Control	Add/remove staff, assign roles (admin, server, kitchen), set permissions.	Limits who can do what—critical for security and workflow.
Reporting	Pre-built daily/weekly sales, item performance, payment methods; export CSV/PDF.	Basic reporting to compare performance and satisfy accountants.
Settings	Venue profile (hours, address), payment tokens (USDC, ETH, MIMI), QR template.	Configure your venue details and which tokens you accept.

Why these eight pages?

They mirror the absolute minimum of Square/Lightspeed back-offices.

They cover everything from menu updates to closing out the day.

They’re narrow enough to build quickly yet broad enough to run a real restaurant.

Next Steps:

Wire these pages to your chat-first function calls (create_item, get_menu, list_orders, pay_bill, etc.).

Expose quick-actions in each page (e.g. “Add Item,” “Send to Kitchen,” “Issue Refund”).

Iterate with one or two pilot venues to refine flows before layering on loyalty, marketing campaigns, deeper analytics or third-party integrations.
