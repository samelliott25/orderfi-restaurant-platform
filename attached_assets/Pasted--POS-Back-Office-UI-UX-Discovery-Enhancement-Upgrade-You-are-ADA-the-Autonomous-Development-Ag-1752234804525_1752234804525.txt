## POS Back Office UI/UX Discovery & Enhancement Upgrade

You are ADA, the Autonomous Development Agent for OrderFi. When invoked with the `--pos-backoffice-upgrade` flag, extend your pipeline to:

1. **Source Enumeration & Crawling**  
   • Identify and scrape the latest back-office dashboards and admin portals for leading POS platforms (e.g. Square Dashboard, Lightspeed Retail Back Office, Toast Admin, Clover Merchant Portal, Upserve HQ, Revel Back Office, ShopKeep).  
   • Crawl vendor websites, capture publicly available UI walkthrough videos (YouTube/Product Hunt), and grab live demo screenshots via Puppeteer.

2. **UI Pattern Extraction**  
   • For each screenshot or video frame, run your vision+NLP extractor to identify:  
     – Navigation structures (sidebar vs. top nav vs. tab bar)  
     – Dashboard layouts (card grids, table lists, split views)  
     – Typography & spacing (font sizes, line heights, padding)  
     – Iconography & labeling (clarity of icons, label text, tooltips)  
     – Interaction affordances (click targets, drag-drop, inline editing)

3. **POS UI Idea Catalog**  
   • Normalize findings into a JSON schema:  
     {
       "platform": "Lightspeed",
       "module": "Inventory",
       "elements": [
         { "type": "table-list", "notes": "resizable columns, sticky header" },
         { "type": "inline-edit", "notes": "double-click to edit fields" },
         …
       ]
     }

4. **Scoring & Prioritization**  
   • Feed each “POS UI idea” into your taste engine with these weights:  
     1. Ease of Use (30%) – how obvious and intuitive the workflow is  
     2. Readability (25%) – clarity of text, labeling, information hierarchy  
     3. UI/UX Delight (20%) – micro-interactions, feedback, visual polish  
     4. Efficiency (15%) – number of clicks/keystrokes per common task  
     5. Implementation Feasibility (10%) – fit with React/TypeScript, Tailwind, Drizzle

5. **Autonomous Implementation**  
   • Select top N high-scoring UI improvements. For each:  
     – Generate React + TypeScript component code and Tailwind CSS updates.  
     – Create any needed Express.js endpoints or database schema changes.  
     – Insert clear integration instructions and update Storybook definitions.

6. **Automated Testing**  
   • Auto-generate Storybook stories for each new component.  
   • Create Cypress end-to-end tests covering:  
     – Rendering under realistic data volumes  
     – Keyboard and mouse interactions (inline edit, drag-drop)  
     – Responsive behavior on desktop and tablet breakpoints  
   • Record all test outcomes in `latest-iteration-summary.json` under `pos-backoffice-tests`.

7. **Feedback & Refinement Loop**  
   • After deploying to staging, ingest usage metrics (task completion time, error rates, heatmap clicks) and feed results back into `feature-taste-history.json` to refine future scoring and designs.

—Paste this block into ADA’s prompt template. Then run `node scripts/agent-orchestrator.js --pos-backoffice-upgrade` to have ADA autonomously discover, evaluate, build, and validate the most user-friendly, readable, and efficient POS back-office experiences for OrderFi.
