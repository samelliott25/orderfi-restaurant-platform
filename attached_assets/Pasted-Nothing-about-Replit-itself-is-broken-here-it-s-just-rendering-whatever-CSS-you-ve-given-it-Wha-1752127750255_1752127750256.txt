Nothing about Replit itself is “broken” here – it’s just rendering whatever CSS you’ve given it. What Replit (or any browser) needs to “understand” is that your layout must actually be built to respond to the viewport size, via:

A proper viewport meta tag in your public/index.html:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
Without this, mobile or narrow‐window layouts will never kick in.

Fluid containers and relative units (%, vw, fr) instead of fixed pixel widths for your main content. For example, wrap your app in a flex container:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="flex h-screen">
  <!-- Sidebar -->
  <aside class="flex-shrink-0 w-16 lg:w-64">…</aside>
  <!-- Main content -->
  <main class="flex-1 overflow-auto p-4">…</main>
</div>
This ensures the <main> region always expands or contracts to fill whatever space is left after the sidebar.

CSS Media Queries (or Tailwind’s responsive utilities) on your cards, grids, and typography. For instance with Tailwind:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="grid gap-4 
                grid-cols-1        /* mobile: one column */
                sm:grid-cols-2     /* ≥640px: two columns */
                lg:grid-cols-4">  /* ≥1024px: four columns */
  {items.map(item => <ItemCard key={item.id} {...item} />)}
</div>
Breakpoints that match common device widths:

sm: ≥640px

md: ≥768px

lg: ≥1024px

xl: ≥1280px

Use those prefixes to adjust padding, font-sizes, grid layouts, etc., at each stage.

Checklist for “Responsive by Default”:
 <meta name="viewport"> is present.

 Your top-level layout uses flex or CSS grid, not absolute pixel dimensions.

 Content panels use flex-shrink-0 for fixed elements (sidebar) and flex-1 for fluid areas.

 Grids, card decks, and typography employ media queries or Tailwind’s sm:, md:, lg: classes.

 No hard-coded width: 1200px; or max-width too small – use max-w-screen-xl or w-full instead.

Once your code follows those principles, Replit’s preview will automatically reflow as you resize the window. If it still “doesn’t get it right,” double-check that:

You’ve rebuilt/restarted after adding the viewport tag.

Your Tailwind config hasn’t overridden the default breakpoints.

You’re not embedding your app inside another container with a fixed size.

With those fixes in place, the page on the right will snap neatly from desktop columns down to a single-column mobile view as the window narrows.
