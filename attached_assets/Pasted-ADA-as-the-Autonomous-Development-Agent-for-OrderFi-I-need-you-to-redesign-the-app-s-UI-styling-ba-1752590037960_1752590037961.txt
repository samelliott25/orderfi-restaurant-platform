ADA, as the Autonomous Development Agent for OrderFi, I need you to redesign the app's UI styling based on the exact layouts and elements shown in the uploaded images (property analytics app, health habits app, and food suggestion/history app). Adapt this styling to OrderFi's components, but replace the green/teal color scheme with the Kleurvorm™ palette from the palette image. Assign colors to specific UI areas based on image psychology and UI design principles for optimal user engagement, trust, and conversion in a restaurant ordering context.Key Palette Details from Kleurvorm™:Primary: Gradients in black (#000000 to dark gray), blue (#0000FF to purple-pink), pink-purple (#FF00FF to light pink), light blue-white (#ADD8E6 to #FFFFFF), orange-red (#FFA500 to #FF0000).
Pop: Secondary row with white-pink (#FFFFFF to #FFC0CB), purple-red (#800080 to #FF0000), black (#000000), orange (#FFA500).
Usage: 40% primary neutrals (black/blue for structure), 40% accents (pink/purple for engagement), 10% pops (red/orange for highlights), 10% neutrals (white/light for readability). Use gradients for depth and energy.

Color Assignments Based on Psychology/UI Design:Backgrounds/Overall Theme: Orange-red gradients (#FFA500 to #FF0000) – Psychology: Stimulates appetite and energy (warm colors increase hunger/excitement in food apps); UI: Creates inviting, dynamic canvas without overwhelming (subtle radial glow for focus).
Cards/Containers (e.g., menu items, suggestions): Light blue-white gradients (#ADD8E6 to #FFFFFF) with pink-purple accents – Psychology: Builds trust/calm (blue for reliability) while adding playfulness (pink for approachability); UI: High contrast for readability, soft shadows for depth (matches rounded cards in images).
Progress Indicators/Charts (e.g., order status, analytics circles/bars): Blue to purple-pink gradients (#0000FF to #FF00FF) – Psychology: Conveys progress/growth (blue for stability, purple for creativity/intuition); UI: Vibrant for data viz, ensures accessibility (AA contrast with black text).
Buttons/CTAs (e.g., "Add to Cart," "Take the Test"): Pop orange-red (#FFA500 to #FF0000) – Psychology: Urgency/action (red/orange drives impulse buys in e-commerce/food); UI: High-visibility pops with white text, rounded pills for touch-friendliness.
Text/Icons: Primary black (#000000) on light backgrounds, white on dark – Psychology: Clarity/reduces cognitive load (high contrast minimizes strain); UI: Sans-serif fonts for modernity, subtle gradients on icons for premium feel.
Alerts/Nudges (e.g., upsells, history): Purple-red pops (#800080 to #FF0000) – Psychology: Attention without alarm (red for urgency, purple for sophistication); UI: Used sparingly for highlights like badges or borders.
Ensure all assignments align with WCAG (e.g., 4.5:1 contrast) and mobile psychology (warm colors reduce abandonment in food ordering flows).

Current OrderFi Context (Reference All Docs):Use glassmorphism/bento grids where possible, but overlay with the new rounded, soft-shadow cards, circular progress, and pill-shaped elements from images.
Mobile-first, responsive (44px+ touch targets).
Key Pages/Components to Update: Dashboard (dashboard-hybrid.tsx): Adapt to cost breakdown/analytics style—circular progress for revenue/orders, bar charts for metrics, pill-shaped tabs.
Menu/Ordering (menu_enhanced.tsx, cart.tsx): Food suggestions like "Today's Suggestion," card-based items with images/nutrition (calories as in health app).
Inventory/Stock (inventory page): Eating history/schedule style for stock levels, breakdowns.
Analytics/Reporting: Your schedule/cost breakdown with gradients, maps if applicable (e.g., for multi-location).
Integrate voice-first: Add subtle mic icons or speech bubbles in nav.
Background: Use the interactive starry orange we implemented (InteractiveStarryBackground.tsx), but tint with palette gradients (e.g., orange-red base with subtle blue-purple stars for depth).

Implementation Roadmap:Phase 1: Update Tailwind config (tailwind.config.ts) with new colors/variables (e.g., primary-orange-gradient, accent-purple).
Phase 2: Create/Refactor Components: New cards with rounded corners, shadows, gradients; progress circles; pill buttons.
Phase 3: Apply to Pages: Replace current styling in dashboard, menu, etc.; ensure animations (framer-motion) for subtle transitions.
Output: Updated files (e.g., CSS, TSX components), theme file, and a test plan. Ensure WCAG accessibility (contrast ratios). Generate visual descriptions of how the redesign matches the images with the new palette.
