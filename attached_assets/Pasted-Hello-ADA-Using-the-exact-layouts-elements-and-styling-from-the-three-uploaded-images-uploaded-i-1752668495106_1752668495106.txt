Hello ADA! Using the exact layouts, elements, and styling from the three uploaded images (uploaded_image1.png: property analytics app; uploaded_image2.png: health habits app; uploaded_image3.png: food suggestion/history app), generate a complete React + Tailwind CSS codebase for the OrderFi app. Adapt EVERY page, button, card, and element to this design language, but replace the green/teal scheme with the Kleurvorm™ palette from uploaded_palette.png.

Key Palette Details & Psychology-Based Assignments:
- Primary: Gradients in black (#1e1e2a for structure – psychology: stability/trust in dashboards), blue (#2233ff to purple-pink #8d5fff/#f53855 for accents – psychology: creativity/intuition for suggestions/menus), light blue-white (#cad7ff to #ffffff for backgrounds/cards – psychology: calm/readability to reduce cognitive load), orange-red (#ff7e5f to #f53855 for pops – psychology: appetite stimulation/urgency for CTAs/upsells).
- Pop: White-pink (#ffffff to #ffc0cb for subtle highlights – psychology: approachability in profiles), purple-red (#800080 to #ff0000 for alerts – psychology: attention without alarm), black (#000000 for text – high contrast), orange (#ffa500 for icons – energy).
- Usage: 40% neutrals (black/blue for nav/text), 40% accents (pink/purple for cards/charts), 10% pops (red/orange for buttons/progress), 10% light (white/blue for space). Use gradients for depth (e.g., radial on cards for focus, linear on backgrounds for flow).

OrderFi Context (Reference All Docs):
- Mobile-first, responsive (44px+ touch targets, glassmorphism overlays where fits – e.g., subtle blur on cards).
- Integrate existing: Starry orange background (InteractiveStarryBackground.tsx – tint with orange-red gradient); voice-first (add mic icons/speech bubbles in nav/cards); bento grids for dashboards.
- Pages to Scaffold (Full Implementations):
  - HomePage.jsx: Hero like "Build healthy habits" but "Welcome to OrderFi" with menu suggestions, stats cards (e.g., daily orders/calories as revenue/items).
  - Dashboard.jsx: Analytics like cost breakdown – circular progress for revenue, bar charts for metrics, pill tabs.
  - Orders.jsx: History/schedule like eating history – cards for orders with status, totals, maps for delivery.
  - Profile.jsx: User info with preferences (dietary/favorites), add friend-like "Loyalty Connections".
  - Settings.jsx: Notifications/payments with toggles, save button.
- Components: Button.jsx (pill-shaped, variants: primary orange-red gradient for CTAs, secondary blue, outline black); Card.jsx (rounded, shadows, gradients); NavBar.jsx (bottom nav with lucide-react icons: Home, Cart, User, Settings – blue icons); Layout.jsx (wraps pages with starry background, nav); Add ProgressCircle.jsx (for metrics, blue-purple gradient).
- Routing: Use wouter (already in package.json) – set up routes in App.jsx.
- Enhancements: Framer-motion for subtle animations (e.g., card fade-ins); accessibility (ARIA labels, contrast); psychology nudges (e.g., scarcity badges in red on suggestions).

Implementation Roadmap:
- Phase 1: Update tailwind.config.js/postcss.config.js with colors/gradients (e.g., bg-gradient-primary).
- Phase 2: Create all components with full code, using Tailwind + variables.
- Phase 3: Implement all pages with sample OrderFi data (e.g., menu items from docs), integrate voice icons.
- Output: Full src folder code (every file with complete JSX/TS); theme.css with variables; test plan (e.g., snapshots for components). Describe visual match (e.g., "Dashboard circular progress uses blue-purple for growth psychology").

Leave no stone unturned—provide EVERY file with FULL code, ensuring the design matches images exactly but with palette/psychology assignments.
