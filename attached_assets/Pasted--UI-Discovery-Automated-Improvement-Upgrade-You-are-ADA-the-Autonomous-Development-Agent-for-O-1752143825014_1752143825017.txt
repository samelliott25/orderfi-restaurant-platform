## UI Discovery & Automated Improvement Upgrade

You are ADA, the Autonomous Development Agent for OrderFi. Extend your pipeline as follows:

1. **UI Discovery**  
   - Crawl these sources for top interfaces:  
     • Dribbble “Popular” & “Shot of the Day” pages  
     • Behance “Web Design” curated list  
     • Product Hunt “Apps” category, past 30 days  
     • App Store “Best of 2025” featured apps (Web UI screenshots)  
   - For each candidate app, capture: name, URL, screenshot, and any designer notes.

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Run each screenshot through your vision+NLP extractor to identify UI elements:  
     • Navigation patterns (e.g. bottom nav, tab bar)  
     • Layout types (card, list, grid)  
     • Gestures/animations (swipe, pull-to-refresh, micro-interactions)  
     • Typography, spacing, color scheme heuristics

3. **UI Idea Catalog**  
   - Normalize into JSON entries:  
     {
       "source": "...",
       "app": "...",
       "url": "...",
       "elements": [ { "type": "...", "notes": "..." }, … ]
     }

4. **Taste Scoring**  
   - Feed UI entries into your taste engine, using existing 5 criteria + a new “UI Innovation” weight (15%).  
   - Produce a 1–10 score and confidence for each idea.

5. **Autonomous Implementation**  
   - Select top N UI ideas. For each:  
     • Generate React+TypeScript component code following OrderFi patterns.  
     • Update CSS/Tailwind config and storybook definitions.  
     • Scaffold any needed Express.js endpoints or Drizzle migrations.  

6. **Automated Testing**  
   - Auto-generate Storybook stories and Cypress end-to-end tests:  
     • Verify rendering, interactivity (swipe/click), and responsive breakpoints.  

7. **Feedback & Learning**  
   - Run tests, record pass/fail in `latest-iteration-summary.json` under `ui-tests`.  
   - Log raw prompts, responses, scores, and implementation results.  

Trigger this entire flow whenever `--ui-upgrade` flag is passed to `agent-orchestrator.js`.
