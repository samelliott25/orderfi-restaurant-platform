a Daily Sales Summary is one of the most valuable reports in any restaurant, whether it’s a fast-casual bar or a fine-dining venue. It helps the operator quickly answer:

“Did we make money today? What sold, what didn’t, and where did we lose or gain efficiency?”

Let’s break it down into what a restaurant manager or owner actually wants to see, and how to translate that into your OrderFi AI POS MVP.
