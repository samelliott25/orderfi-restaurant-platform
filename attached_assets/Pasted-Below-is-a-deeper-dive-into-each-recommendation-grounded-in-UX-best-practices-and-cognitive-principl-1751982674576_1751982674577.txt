Below is a deeper dive into each recommendation—grounded in UX best practices and cognitive principles—so you can see why each change matters and where the reasoning comes from.

1. Spotlight Primary Actions
What to Do
Floating “Add New Item” Button in the bottom‐right corner (48×48 px minimum)

Convert “Quick Actions” into Icon-Plus-Label Pills just below the page title

Why
Fitts’s Law tells us large, isolated targets reduce acquisition time and errors—critical for managers who aren’t power users.

Nielsen’s “Visibility of System Status” heuristic: surfacing the most common actions (“Add,” “Reorder,” “Categories”) makes your system feel responsive and predictable.

2. Consolidate Search, Voice & Filters
What to Do
Merge the separate search bar, “Voice” button, and filter chips into a single unified input with inline filter toggles.

Show active filters as removable chips below the input.

Why
According to Miller’s Law (7±2 rule), humans can juggle only a handful of elements in working memory. One combined control reduces mental load.

Recognition over Recall (Nielsen): users pick filters they see, rather than digging through dropdowns.

3. Rework the Tab Strip
What to Do
Highlight Active Tab by filling it with your brand gradient and using a bold typeface.

Limit to Three Tabs (e.g. Overview, Browse, Reports); move less-used modes (e.g. “Categories”) behind a dropdown or within “Browse.”

Why
Progressive Disclosure: hides complexity until needed—avoiding overwhelm for new users.

Clear, bold indicators align with the “Recognition rather than recall” principle, so managers always know where they are.

4. Improve the Card & List Views
What to Do
Hover-Reveal Actions: hide the pencil icon until hover (or focus) to minimize clutter.

Right-Align Numeric Columns in the Data List (Price, Stock, Margin).

Consistent Padding & Borders: tighten card grid gutters to 8px, and use a 1px light-gray border that intensifies on hover.

Why
Gestalt Proximity: grouping related data tightly helps the eye parse rows or cards more quickly.

Data Tables: right-aligning numbers speeds comparison, per standard spreadsheet conventions.

5. Enhance the Overview Dashboard
What to Do
Combine “Overview” & “Reports”: in one screen show metrics plus big “Generate Report” buttons.

Recent Activity → Drill-In Links: make each log entry clickable to edit that item directly.

Why
Jakob Nielsen’s “Flexibility & Efficiency of Use”: giving power users shortcuts (click-through logs) accelerates workflows, while novices still get guidance.

Contextual Linking reduces “dead ends,” so users never feel stuck.

6. Use Color & Iconography Consistently
What to Do
Status Colors (green/orange/red) always mean the same: available, low-stock, out-of-stock.

Add semantic icons (✓, ⚠, ✕) next to text labels.

Why
Dual-Coding Theory (Paivio): pairing color + icon + text ensures at least one channel “clicks” for every user.

Maintains consistency across views—vital for memorability.

7. Inline Help & Onboarding
What to Do
One-Click “Quick Help” Cards that overlay short voice tips (“Say ‘Show low stock’ to filter”).

Step-By-Step Take-Tour with only 3 stops: Search → Edit → Reorder.

Why
Progressive Onboarding (UX best practice): bite-sized tours prevent cognitive overload.

Nielsen’s “Help and Documentation”: always available but not in the main flow.

8. Mobile & Tablet Considerations
What to Do
Responsive Sidebar → Bottom Nav with icons + labels.

Swipeable Tabs for “Overview” ↔ “Browse” ↔ “Reports.”

Why
On touch devices, a bottom nav is within thumb’s reach (Thumb Zone in mobile design).

Swipe gestures feel natural on tablets and mirror native app patterns.

By mapping each UI tweak back to proven usability heuristics, cognitive load theory, and real-world checkout patterns, you’ll ensure even non-technical restaurant managers find the Inventory module intuitive, efficient, and error-resilient.
