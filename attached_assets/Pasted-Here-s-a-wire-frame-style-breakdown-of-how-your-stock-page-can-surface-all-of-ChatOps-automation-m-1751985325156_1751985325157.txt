Here’s a wire-frame–style breakdown of how your /stock page can surface all of ChatOps’ automation magic while still feeling familiar and intuitive—especially for non-technical restaurant managers.

2. Key UI Components
A. Stock Summary Cards (Top Row)
What: Four big cards showing “Total SKUs,” “Items Below Threshold,” “Pending POs,” “Overdue Invoices.”

Why: Gives an instant pulse on inventory health—mirrors “Dashboard” in Square/Lightspeed.

How:

Use simple icons (📦, ⚠, 🔄, 📧) + bold numbers + one-click drill-in (“View Details”).

B. ChatOps Panel (Floating & Docked)
What: A persistent chat bubble or slide-up panel that can be expanded for free-form or chip-guided prompts.

Why: Keeps your AI agent front-and-center. Managers can type or speak “Show low-stock items” and see the table auto-filter.

How:

At rest, show 3 suggestion chips (e.g. “Low-Stock Items,” “Auto-Reorder ON/OFF,” “Run Report”).

On expand, full transcript + input field + function-call confirmations.

C. Low-Stock Table / Grid
What: Core inventory list—with virtualization for performance if SKUs scale.

Why: Managers need a familiar tabular view to scan, sort, and act.

How:

Columns:

Item (with thumbnail + name)

On-Hand (right-aligned number)

Threshold (editable inline or via ChatOps)

Reorder Qty (auto-calculated, but can override)

Supplier (dropdown link)

Last PO (date link)

Actions (Reorder button, Edit card)

Filters & Search: combined search/voice bar above the table; filter chips for “Below Threshold,” “By Supplier,” etc.

D. Activity & Audit Feed
What: A scrollable pane or slide-in drawer showing the last 10 ChatOps actions (e.g. “Auto-PO #123 created,” “Invoice #456 sent”).

Why: Builds trust: managers see what the AI did, when, and can click “Undo” or “Details.”

How:

Timestamped entries with icons (🛒, 📄, 🔔).

Click to expand details or trigger “Repeat” commands.

3. Interaction Patterns
One-Click Reorder

From the “Items Below Threshold” card: click it to auto-generate POs for all low-stock items in one go.

Inline Inline-Editing

Click on a threshold cell to type a new number, or say “Set wings threshold to 10”—ChatOps confirms in the panel.

Voice-Activated Filters

Tap the mic icon and say “Show me items under 5 units,” and the table instantly filters.

Scheduled Report Toggle

A little calendar icon on the header that flips between “Auto-Report: ON” (green) or “OFF” (grey), clicking it brings up a scheduler modal.

4. Mobile & Tablet Adaptations
Bottom Nav replaces sidebar; include “Summary,” “Inventory,” “Activity.”

Collapsible Cards on mobile so the Summary or ChatOps panel can collapse to make room for the table.

Swipe-To-Act on table rows for “Reorder” or “Edit.”

5. Why This Works
Familiar Structure + ChatOps Overlay: your managers get the tabular clarity they know, plus the power of a voice/chat assistant.

Progressive Disclosure: summary cards → detailed table → row-level editing, so you never show overwhelming data all at once.

Affordances & Feedback: big buttons, inline edits, and real-time ChatOps confirmations ensure visibility of system status and quick error recovery.

By combining summary cards, a robust table, a transparent activity feed, and a powerful ChatOps panel, your /stock page will feel both approachable for novice staff and efficient for power users—while seamlessly automating the heavy lifting in the background.
