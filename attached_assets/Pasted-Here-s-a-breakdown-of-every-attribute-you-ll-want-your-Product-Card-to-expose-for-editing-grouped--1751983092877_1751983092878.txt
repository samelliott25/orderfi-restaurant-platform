Here’s a breakdown of every attribute you’ll want your “Product Card” to expose for editing—grouped by logical section to keep the UI clear. This covers both the standard POS needs (think Square/Lightspeed) and your voice/AI–first requirements.

1. Basic Item Info
Name (e.g. “Pepperoni Pizza”)

Description (full text, markdown-style if you like)

Category (drop-down or voice/intent tag)

Subcategory (optional second level)

Item ID / SKU (UUID or short code; hidden by default but editable for integrations)

2. Pricing & Cost
Sale Price (e.g. $15.99)

Cost Price (COGS)

Margin (computed, read-only)

Tax Rate / Tax Category (GST/VAT settings)

Loyalty Points (e.g. 1 point per $1 spent)

3. Inventory & Ordering
Stock Level (current on-hand)

Unit of Measure (ea, kg, liter, etc.)

Reorder Threshold (trigger “Low Stock” alerts)

Supplier (link to vendor record)

Purchase Unit Cost (for POs)

Order Multiple (pack size for auto-reorders)

4. Variants & Modifiers
Variant Groups (size, flavor, etc.)

Modifier Sets (e.g. “No onions,” “Add extra cheese”)

Modifier Prices (price delta for each modifier)

Default Modifiers (pre-checked options)

5. Availability & Scheduling
Active / Inactive toggle

Availability Window (days of week, time-ranges)

Sold Out Flag (manual override)

6. Media & Branding
Main Image (upload URL)

Gallery / Carousel (additional images)

Icon / Badge (e.g. “GF,” “Vegan”)

Color Accent (for category boards or card border)

7. Voice & AI Integration
Voice Aliases (JSON list of synonyms: “pep pizza,” “pepper pie”)

Trigger Phrases (e.g. “what’s in this?”, “any nuts?”)

Intent Tag (e.g. add_to_order, filter_vegan)

Search Keywords (for full-text & trigram indexing)

8. Compliance & Nutrition (Optional)
Allergen Warnings (nuts, dairy, gluten)

Nutrition Facts (calories, macros)

Serving Size (g/ml)

9. Integrations & Metadata
External IDs (e.g. Stripe product ID, accounting SKU)

Barcode / QR Code (for fallback or kitchen printing)

Custom Attributes (freeform JSON for plugins)

UI Suggestions
Accordion Sections: group the above into collapsible panels (“Pricing,” “Inventory,” “Voice & AI”) so you never overwhelm the manager.

Inline Edit + Save: changes autosave per panel; show a subtle “Saved” toast or turn the panel header green.

Voice-Command Hints: next to each field, show a microphone icon with a hover-tip: “Say ‘Set price to $16’.”

Live Preview: as you edit “Voice Aliases,” test-match against a sample utterance (“pep pizza”) and confirm it resolves to this item_id.

By exposing all of these fields—while organizing them into digestible sections and pairing them with voice hints—you’ll give managers full control over every aspect of their menu items, without the clutter or cognitive overload of a hundred scattered settings.
