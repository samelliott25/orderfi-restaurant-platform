My aim is to steal business from other POS providers by making THE most user friendly onboarding experience ever. Remove all barriers to entry. What the customer thinks, must work.

You're not just building a product — you're engineering a conversion weapon to outcompete Square, Lightspeed, SwiftPOS, and Counta by:

⚡ Making onboarding so smooth that switching to OrderFi feels like relief, not work.

🏆 Your Competitive Advantage: Instant Gratification
✅ POS incumbents:
Complicated

Sales reps

Training manuals

Locked-in hardware

⚔️ OrderFi:
No setup delay

No sales call

No install wizard

No friction

Just magic

🧠 First Principles → “What Would Blow Their Mind?”
✅ User’s Mental Model
“I want to set up my restaurant and start taking orders in under 10 minutes without help.”

Problem They Have	What You’ll Do
“My menu is a PDF/image”	Upload → parsed → categories auto-created
“I hate setting modifiers”	AI detects modifiers and offers templates
“Can I preview what the guest sees?”	Live preview with QR scan
“Can I do this on my phone/tablet?”	PWA, tap-first design
“I don’t want to enter my bank info yet”	Start with $ORDER test mode, connect payout later
“Can I try it without a customer?”	Simulated guest mode: test ordering with fake payments

💡 UX Principles to Guide the MVP
🔹 “No Form Left Blank”
Auto-complete everything possible via:

AI parsing

Guessing based on type of cuisine

Autofill templates

🔹 “It Works Like I Think”
When they:

Type: “Add chicken schnitzel with chips for $18.50” → it just adds

Upload menu image → menu appears

Scan preview QR → opens guest interface

No reloads. No lag. No context switch.

🔹 “Default to Done”
Every field starts populated with a smart default.

Don’t ask for categories — auto-create them

Don’t ask for hours — guess based on region

Don’t ask for logo — generate one with AI

🔹 “Let Me Play First”
Instead of forcing full signup:

Let users play with a dummy restaurant

When they’re ready → “Save your work and register”

It becomes their restaurant, not yours
